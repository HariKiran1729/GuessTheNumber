# ðŸŽ® Multiplayer Setup Instructions

## Important Note About Multiplayer Functionality

Due to the limitations of GitHub Pages (static hosting), true real-time multiplayer across different devices/browsers requires additional setup. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Same Device/Browser (Easiest)
**Best for: Testing or local play**
1. Player 1 creates a room in one browser tab
2. Player 2 joins in another tab of the same browser
3. Both players can play normally

## Option 2: Enhanced GitHub Pages Version (Recommended)
For true cross-device multiplayer, you'll need to:

1. **Use a real-time database service** like:
   - Firebase Realtime Database (free tier available)
   - Supabase (free tier available)  
   - PlanetScale (free tier available)

2. **Modify the JavaScript** to replace localStorage with API calls

## Option 3: Alternative Hosting
Host on platforms that support real-time features:
- **Netlify** (with Netlify Functions)
- **Vercel** (with API routes)
- **Heroku** (free tier with Node.js/Socket.io)

## Quick Fix for GitHub Pages

If you want to keep it simple on GitHub Pages, the current version works for:
- **Same browser, different tabs** (both players on same computer)
- **Testing the game mechanics**
- **Demonstrating the game concept**

## Future Enhancement: Firebase Integration

To make it truly multiplayer, you would:
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Replace localStorage calls with Firebase Realtime Database
3. Add Firebase SDK to your HTML
4. Modify the JavaScript to use Firebase instead of localStorage
